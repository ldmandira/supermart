# supermart
We are creating an app for the general use of a supermarket. It mainly includes online ordering system.Customers can save their time by using this scanner because they can scan QR codes of relevant item and get details quickly. When item is selected the app shows the rack no which that item is stored.If the customer has loyalty card, that customer can find customer's balance by using this app.

In this project my part is to create qr code scanner and generate the qr of items.
